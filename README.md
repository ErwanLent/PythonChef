PythonChef
==========

PythonChef is a personal project of mine that combines cooking and python. As I am a horrible cook taking a python class, I decided to combine both into a cooking blog powered by python. This repo is currently the design only of the project. The python backend may or may not be included later on.

Enjoy.
