PythonChef
==========

PythonChef is a personal project of mine that combines cooking and python. As I am both a horrible cook and a student learning python, I decided to combine both into a cooking blog powered by python. This repo is currently the FRONT-END of the project only. The python backend will be included later on.


The site can be found live at http://pythonchef.com/

Enjoy.
